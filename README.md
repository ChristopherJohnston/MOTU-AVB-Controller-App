# Simple MOTU AVB Controller

A flutter app for controlling MOTU AVB interfaces through a simplified UI.

This app enables a custom-configured UI for controlling subsets of faders, panners and buttons without the need to use the MOTU interface's full Touch Console UI.
An example use case would be exposing various aux headphone mixes for individuals to control.

This app is inspired by and uses components from the [MOTU Simple Control Panel](https://github.com/Hecsall/motu_simple_control_panel) project.
